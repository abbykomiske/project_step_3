### Brainstorming

## New Research Question: Can the use of language analysis from US court decisions in North Carolina help predict future judicial behavior in America? 

- This needs to be refined/concentrated and I know there are a lot of holes... Predict what? winning/losing in general or only in cases where circumstances are similar?? Unsure... However, considering that precedent matters so much in the courts, general patterns should illuminate some kind of information about how judges would approach similar cases in the future. 

## - What is the ideal data and ideal dataset(s) will be necessary to address your research problem and statement? Describe the data and dataset(s) in terms of their content, structure, and format.

The US rulings in Harvard's Caselaw Access Project database could be used for this. They have all public court decisions possible, so I could include all cases present at the federal, state, and local levels. The ideal data set would then be structured to include language pattern analysis - word frequency, name, tone analysis, legal terminology, and the length and/or complexity (using a complexity calculator/algorithm) of sentences. With these measures in line, they could be compared with the outcome of the case, whether in favor of the plaintiff or defendant. From there, it may be possible to predict if certain measures in legal language show favor toward a plaintiff or defendant.    

## - What are the available data and/ or datasets that (best) align with your idealized data and dataset(s)? Describe where there is alignment and misalignment. How will you address any misalignment?

The Harvard CaseLaw database would align well with my study because there is all the corpora I could possibly need or get access to. 


### Draft a data preparation strategy

1. Develop a data preparation strategy that outlines the data and dataset(s) that will be necessary to address your research problem and statement. Your strategy should outline the acquisition, curation, and transformation of the data and dataset(s) and should address the following questions:

First, I would need to access the Harvard Caselaw Project. I need to compile all of the corpora I will be using into one. It seems like they can be accessed via JSON files, so I would need to learn/understand how to manipulate those and tabularize the meta data that those contain. I will most likely also have to narrow my research into a state or a certain court level within all the states so that all information found in them can be referenced to each other for pattern recognitoin. I would prefer to do all appellate court decisions in the US, minus other territories, or either DC, MD, or NC. 
Then, I would need to quantify and curate for word frequency, name of defendants/plaintiffs, who won, issue, type of suit, tone analysis, legal terminology, and the length and/or complexity (using a complexity calculator/algorithm) of sentences within each case. 
With this, I would need to then consider other factors that might influence the court decisions, like location perhaps. 


## Assessing your progress

1. Reflect on the process of identifying a data preparation strategy.

Some questions to consider:

- What did you learn?

I learned more about my research question and had to actually think about the data curation steps, which was great progress for my project. 

- What did you find most/ least challenging?

I think making the data curation steps is the hardest.

- What resources did you consult?

I consulted the professor and the textbook. 

- What questions or concerns do you have at this point?

I know I will need more assistance with my data curation down the road, but for now I have a good start. 

- What do you need to address in order to move forward?

I need to start the actual steps of taking my data from Harvard Caselaw and curating/transforming the available corpus for my project. This comes down to my data preparation strategy, which is currently very loose and I need guidance on. 
Also, how can I make a BibTex citation for the entire database since I want to cite Harvard Caselaw.  

## Consider how your prospectus is shaping up.

- How have your interests evolved?

My interests have definitely evolved. I knew I wanted to focus on legal linguistics, but I have explored a lot of areas within that to get where I am now. 

- How have your research questions and objectives evolved?

Yes, my research question has changed just in the last few weeks. I thought I wanted to compare legal with nonlegal corpus, but now I want to use just legal corpus to predict something, which is most likely judicial behavior. Meeting on April 1st has helped me understand the directions I can go in with this. 

- How have these changes been influenced by the literature you have reviewed and/ or the knowledge you have gained in this course?

This change has happened because I have come into contact with the Harvard cite for corpus, which honestly feels like a gold mine. With access to all public legal corpus in the US at my fingertips, doing a holistic study to find patterns and see if there is a general trajectory of judicial behavior could be really groundbreaking in such a new field.
